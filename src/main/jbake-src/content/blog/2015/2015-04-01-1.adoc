Yesterday on March 31st, we had a good number of Meetings with other folks of JBoss in the new new
Red Hat office in Newcastle, called _The Pub_.
Among others we were also discussing the future of Monitoring. After all the beers^w discussions we have decided to
discontinue Hawkular.

We found out that software is always at fault:

* it does not have all the features users want
* it is too slow (always!)
* it uses too much memory
* it uses too much cpu

So instead of investing more time and effort into Hawkular, we will replace it with this new Microservice

[source,java]
----
public static String isHealthy(String resource) {
    return "no";
}
----

All the existing Hawkular source code will be donated to the 1. Association of Possibly Retired Invariant Lines of
code.

Thanks for your attention
