We are pretty happy, that Hawkular is participating in this years edition of
https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/dashboard/google/gsoc2015[_Google Summer of Code_] (GSoC) with two
projects:

* Aakarsh Agarwal on _Hawkular - pluggable data processors for metrics_:

____
Hawkular-metrics deals with computation of
values and operations on the raw data. This project is aimed to develop interface for plugins that improve the
performance of Hawkular-Metrics making it more dependable, dynamic and extending the scope of its usage in operating
with data sets.Plugins are needed to apply statistical algorithms to the data and compute those necessary functions.
Such plugins may be plugged in at runtime whenever user wants it to.

Mobile phones, especially smartphones, came to our life very quickly.
We use them every day and sometimes more often than our computers. At the moment there is no way to use Hawkular
comfortably on Android, there is only a web interface. This conclusion assumes that some work should be done to
provide a new way of user interaction with Hawkular. My work is to implement this idea in an Android application for
Hawkular.
____

The later proposal is done together with the Aerogear project. Daniel Passos from https://aerogear.org[AeroGear] is
the official mentor for the student.
