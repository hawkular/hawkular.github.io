I'm pleased to introduce a new component to the Hawkular family aimed at delivering a *Business Transaction Management* solution. The initial focus will be on tracing a business transaction across a range of resources, on-premises and in the cloud, to provide an end to end view helping to isolate business transaction failures and performance bottlenecks.

At this stage we are still putting together high level plans and hope to start publishing more details of a roadmap over the coming weeks.

If you have requirements in this area, please feel free to https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKBTM[create a jira], or discuss them on our http://www.hawkular.org/community/join.html[irc channel or dev mailing list].
