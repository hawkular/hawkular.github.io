Hawkular Metrics is able to store data coming from http://collectd.org/[collectd, window="_blank"]. To enable this
feature, you need to start the
https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics/tree/master/clients/ptranslator[ptrans, window="_blank"] proxy, point it
to your Metrics server, and configure the collectd network plugin to send data to ptrans.

== Regression test requirements

To make sure the collectd/ptrans/Hawkular stack never gets broken, we wanted to have an integration test. This test
should fill the following requirements:

* do not fail the build on machines where collectd is not available (non-Linux developers machines, or simply machines
where collectd is not installed)
* run on Travis-CI, where each pull request is tested before being merged
* make sure all data sent from collectd lands on the Hawkular Metrics server
* run as quickly as possible

Here's an outline of the implementation.

=== Skip test when collectd is not available

https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Assumptions-with-assume[jUnit Assumptions, window="_blank"] provide a nice way
to test the presence of external dependencies. The default jUnit runner will skip the test if the assumption fails. So
skipping the test when collectd is not available is just a matter of testing if the collectd binary exists, is a regular
file, and is executable.

[source,java]
----
private static final String COLLECTD_PATH = System.getProperty("collectd.path", "/usr/sbin/collectd");

// ...

@Before
public void setUp() throws Exception {
    // ...
    assumeCollectdIsPresent();
    // ...
}

private void assumeCollectdIsPresent() {
    Path path = Paths.get(COLLECTD_PATH);
    assumeTrue(COLLECTD_PATH + " does not exist", Files.exists(path));
    assumeTrue(COLLECTD_PATH + " is not a file", Files.isRegularFile(path));
    assumeTrue(COLLECTD_PATH + " is not executable", Files.isExecutable(path));
}
----

=== Run on Travis-CI

http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/installing-dependencies/[
Travis lets you customize the virtual running the build]. Installing packages on the Ubuntu-based VM is very
straightforward, just add a couple of lines in the `before_install` target of your `.travis.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
before_install:
- sudo apt-get update -qq
- sudo apt-get install -qq collectd collectd-utils
----

=== Verify data has landed on the Metrics server

collectd lets you configure one or more _write plugins_. The network plugin is required to send data to ptrans. We also
activate the csv plugin and make it log the measurements to _stdout_:

[source, conf]
----
LoadPlugin csv
<Plugin csv>
    DataDir stdout
</Plugin>

LoadPlugin network
<Plugin network>
    Server "127.0.0.1" "25826"
    ReportStats false
</Plugin>
----

Then we start collectd, preventing it to fork to the background with the `-f` option, and wait until a minimum number
of measurements has been sent:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void shouldFindCollectdMetricsOnServer() throws Exception {

    // ...

    ImmutableList.Builder<String> collectdCmd = ImmutableList.builder();
    collectdCmd.add(COLLECTD_PATH, "-C", collectdConfFile.getAbsolutePath(), "-f");
    collectdProcessBuilder.command(collectdCmd.build());
    collectdProcess = collectdProcessBuilder.start();

    waitForCollectdValues();

    // ...

}

private void waitForCollectdValues() throws Exception {
    long c;
    do {
        Thread.sleep(MILLISECONDS.convert(1, SECONDS));
        c = Files.lines(collectdOut.toPath())
                 .filter(l -> l.startsWith("PUTVAL"))
                 .collect(counting());
    } while (c < MINIMUM);
}
----

When enough measurements have been collected and sent, all we need to do is to parse collectd _stdout_ and compare with
server data, which can be loaded with an HTTP request.

=== Run as quickly as possible

At this point, all the ingredients can be combined to build an integration test. But the experience showed that running
it could take quite some time, even if the minimum number of measurements was low, and data collectd frequently (every
second).

A bit of investigation demonstrated that the test was spending an unexpected amount of time in  the
`waitForCollectdValues` method. It turned out that buffering of collectd output was the cause. To avoid it, we can use
the `stdbuf` tool from GNU `coreutils`: as explained in the manual page, it's a tool to run a command "with modified
buffering operations for its standard streams".

With this slight modification, the test runs in a few seconds:

[source,java]
----
File stdbuf = new File("/usr/bin/stdbuf");
ImmutableList.Builder<String> collectdCmd = ImmutableList.builder();
if (stdbuf.exists() && stdbuf.canExecute()) {
    collectdCmd.add(stdbuf.getAbsolutePath(), "-o0", "-e0");
}
collectdCmd.add(COLLECTD_PATH, "-C", collectdConfFile.getAbsolutePath(), "-f");
collectdProcessBuilder.command(collectdCmd.build());
collectdProcess = collectdProcessBuilder.start();
----

That's it!
