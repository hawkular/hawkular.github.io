== Hawkular Console

The https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular[Hawkular Console] is based on https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/blob/master/docs/Overview2dotX.md[Hawt.io 2], which a javascript based client-side framework.  Being Hawt.io 2 compatible gives us interopability with other hawt.io consoles such as OpenShift Origin (v3) and Fabric8.
The various directories underneath console directory are Hawt.io 2 plugins and the various plugins eventually compose a Hawkular console.
The modular approach to creating hawt.io console plugins allows us to create individual plugins that comprise a console or can easily  be plugged into other Hawtio based consoles. The plugin system makes it easy to add/remove functionality (even dynamically).

=== Overall Hawkular UI Architecture

=== UI Directory Structure

* ui/console - directory for various Hawkular plugin UIs


The general idea here being hawt.io UIs which are composed of plugins (that can swapped around like legos between the various hawt.io UIs)

=== Maven Install

The easiest way to build the console is to use maven (inside the `ui/console` directory):

`mvn install`

_No system http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] dependencies are needed._
http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] and its related modules are managed by the https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin[frontend-maven-plugin].
This maven plugin abstracts away all of the node and bower dependencies by downloading them locally and running build from a local
directory (no need to install or pollute your java environment with the unsavory characters of node.js and bower).
They are downloaded to the build target (./console/target) directory, where the actual http://gulpjs.com/[Gulp] based build process
(triggered by the maven plugin) happens.

To save some time during the build process, the downloaded http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] files and its related modules
don't have to be deleted after invoking the `clean` target. If you want to persist the node.js related stuff in the target
directory, please use the `cache` profile:

`mvn clean -Pcache`

In that case, the http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] is not deleted and doesn't have to be downloaded again, together with
npm modules and bower packages. Be aware, this causes the libraries not being updated, so there could be issues if a library changes..



=== Hawkular UI Dev Install (using javascript tooling)

_Dev Installs allow for live previewing changes as development occurs. Its an interactive environment that allows one to
prototype quickly, seeing their changes instantly when they save since the browser refreshes with the changes._
 Maven is *not* used for this process. Instead, http://gulpjs.com/[Gulp] build tool is used to build all the typescript/javascript files.
 For agile development, we're using the watch feature of the gulp tool. Gulp can watch for changes in source files
 and update the compiled console accordingly.
 The advantage of this approach is, that is scans for file changes in the source directory and apply them directly
 into the target directory (`$HAWKULAR_ROOT/dist/target/hawkular-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT/hawkular-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT/`), which is suitable for console
 developing since it doesn't require the whole maven build to see the actual changes in the console UI.

Assuming that https://nodejs.org/[node.js] is already installed (can also be installed via rpm or homebrew on mac):

`npm install -g bower gulp typescript`

You can re-build the console using java-script based Gulp tools. There are only three things to remember for this dev build:

. This is done after the maven build and with a running Hawkular server
.. *Build* Hawkular: `mvn clean install -Pdev,link`
.. *Run* Hawkular: `cd dist/target/hawkular-x-y-z-SNAPSHOT/hawkular-x-y-z-SNAPSHOT/bin/` then `./standlone.sh`
. Run gulp commands within gulp-build directory
.. *Goto* gulp-build directory: `cd ui/console/target/gulp-build/`
.. *Run* the gulp watcher: `gulp watch-server`
. *Edit* your source code at: _ui/console/src/main/scripts_
. *Refresh* your browser to see the changes! http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/]
.. _Hint:_ when you build with the -Pdev profile a default user is created with credentials: jdoe/password.

__The editing of source in one directory and running of gulp commands in another can often be a source of confusion for people using the first time.
(this is done to keep the build artifacts out of the source tree)__


Optionally:

The http://bower.io/docs/api/[bower modules] (lib) and node modules https://docs.npmjs.com/[npm](node_modules) should already be built but if you need to change or add more,
you can optionally run:

`npm install`

`bower install`

=== Directory Structure

* dist - directory for  artifacts that need to published via bower package.
* plugins  - directory containing Hawt.io 2 plugins for  Hawkular console. Multiple plugins can be packaged into a single bower component by adding the artifacts to the 'main' section of the bower.json file.
** metrics - metrics is one plugin there are others
*** ts - the typescript source (angular controllers, directives and services mostly)
*** html - the html views (using angular directives)
*** less - the css LESS files

The general idea here being that Hawt.io UIs which are composed of plugins (that can swapped around like legos between the various other Hawt.io UIs)

=== Other Bower Packages development

The `link` profile links other bower packages to hawkular. For example, hawkular-ui-services or hawkular-charts or any other bower package.
This is very useful when developing or debugging other bower packages with hawkular. To enable this just set the `bower.link.package` parameter, i.e.:

`mvn clean install -Pdev,link -Dbower.link.package=hawkular-charts`

Please, be aware, that you can combine the `link` profile with other profiles, like the `dev` profile. _Don't forget to
run `bower link` in the package you're about to link before running maven `link` profile._
