== Introduction

Hawkular Accounts is the Hawkular component that deals with authentication and authorization and is meant to be
consumed by other Hawkular components, such as Metrics, Inventory, Alerts and so on.

There are two main facets for Hawkular Accounts:

* Inner engine, which handles the integration with Keycloak, the permission framework, authorization-related data
storage user interface for logging in, persona switcher, organization management and so on.
* API and helpers for other components, such as CDI providers for authorization and authentication services,
http://hawt.io[hawt.io]
integration, AngularJS events and so on.

== Terms and concepts

See the link:development.html[list of Terms] page.

== Quick start

Hawkular Accounts handles all the login, logout and authentication for Hawkular, both in the front end and in backend,
in a mostly seamless way.

=== Backend

In your backend, you'll need to add the dependency to the Account's API:

`pom.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.hawkular.accounts</groupId>
  <artifactId>hawkular-accounts-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

If you are using a standalone backend instead of Kettle, you'll need to deploy the Hawkular Accounts backend and
install the Keycloak adapters and modules. To do that, please refer to the Keycloak's documentation. You can refer to
the `distribution` module in the Account's source code for an example on how to accomplish that.

For Kettle, the following needs to be added to the `standalone.xsl`:

`standalone.xsl`:
[source,xml]
----
<secure-deployment name="hawkular-accounts.war">
    <realm>hawkular</realm>
    <resource>hawkular-accounts-backend</resource>
    <use-resource-role-mappings>true</use-resource-role-mappings>
    <enable-cors>true</enable-cors>
    <enable-basic-auth>true</enable-basic-auth>
    <credential name="secret"><xsl:value-of select="$uuid.hawkular.accounts.backend" /></credential>
</secure-deployment>
----

You can refer to the http://docs.jboss.org/keycloak/docs/1.2.0.Beta1/userguide/html_single/index.html[Keycloak documentation]
for details on what each option does.

Apart from that, you'll need also to change your `web.xml` to activate the authentication via Keycloak.

[source,xml]
----
<security-constraint>
  <web-resource-collection>
    <web-resource-name>REST endpoints</web-resource-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </web-resource-collection>

  <auth-constraint>
    <role-name>*</role-name>
  </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>

<login-config>
  <auth-method>KEYCLOAK</auth-method>
  <realm-name>hawkular</realm-name>
</login-config>
----

Optionally, and recommended, is the inclusion of a `jboss-web.xml` and `jboss-ejb3.xml` to your project, with the
following content:

`jboss-web.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
<jboss-web xmlns="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee http://www.jboss.org/j2ee/schema/jboss-web_5_1.xsd">
  <security-domain>keycloak</security-domain>
</jboss-web>
----

`jboss-ejb3.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
<jboss:jboss
    xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
    xmlns:jboss="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee"
    xmlns:s="urn:security:1.1"
    version="3.1" impl-version="2.0">

  <assembly-descriptor>
    <s:security>
      <ejb-name>*</ejb-name>
      <s:security-domain>keycloak</s:security-domain>
    </s:security>
  </assembly-descriptor>
</jboss:jboss>
----

Currently, it's not possible to fully take advantage of Keycloak's JAAS provider due to our multi tenancy setup. So, the
secured components should add a `@PermitAll` annotation, to bypass JAAS' permission checking.

After those steps, your backend will start requiring the requests to be authenticated. Requests coming from the UI
will include a token that is used by the Keycloak Wildfly Adapter and verified by contacting a Keycloak Server.

After this is setup, you can inject Hawkular Accounts services directly into your managed beans. You can check the
`samples` module from the Hawkular Accounts project. The source below is taken from there, and shows how a REST
endpoint might consume Hawkular Accounts main services.

[source,java]
----
@Path("/samples")
@PermitAll // we bypass JAAS' protections, as we want to perform the checks inside the methods
@Stateless
public class SampleEndpoint {

    @Inject @HawkularAccountsSample
    EntityManager em;

    @Inject
    Persona currentPersona;

    /**
     * A managed instance of the {@link PermissionChecker}, ready to be used.
     */
    @Inject
    PermissionChecker permissionChecker;

    /**
     * We need the {@link ResourceService} as we need to tell Hawkular Accounts about who created "what". A resource
     * is this "what".
     */
    @Inject
    ResourceService resourceService;

    /**
     * For this example, we have four operations. We get an instance of each of them injected and qualified by its name.
     */
    @Inject
    @NamedOperation("sample-create")
    Operation operationCreate;

    @Inject
    @NamedOperation("sample-read")
    Operation operationRead;

    @Inject
    @NamedOperation("sample-update")
    Operation operationUpdate;

    @Inject
    @NamedOperation("sample-delete")
    Operation operationDelete;

    @GET
    public Response getAllSamples() {
        CriteriaBuilder builder = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
        CriteriaQuery<Sample> query = builder.createQuery(Sample.class);
        Root<Sample> root = query.from(Sample.class);
        query.select(root);
        query.where(builder.equal(root.get(Sample_.ownerId), currentPersona.getId()));

        return Response.ok().entity(em.createQuery(query).getResultList()).build();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("{sampleId}")
    public Response getSample(@PathParam("sampleId") String sampleId) {
        Sample sample = em.find(Sample.class, sampleId);

        // before returning, we check if the current persona has permissions to access this.
        if (permissionChecker.isAllowedTo(operationRead, sample.getId())) {
            return Response.ok().entity(sample).build();
        }

        // the current persona is not allowed, so, return a 404.
        return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
    }

    @POST
    public Response createSample(SampleRequest request) {
        // for this example, we allow everybody to create a sample, but there might be situations where an user can
        // only create resources if they are allowed access to some other resource.
        Sample sample = new Sample(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), currentPersona.getId());
        resourceService.create(sample.getId(), currentPersona);
        sample.setName(request.getName());

        em.persist(sample);
        return Response.ok().entity(sample).build();
    }

    @DELETE
    @Path("{sampleId}")
    public Response removeSample(@PathParam("sampleId") String sampleId) {
        Sample sample = em.find(Sample.class, sampleId);
        Resource resource = resourceService.get(sampleId);

        // check if the current user can perform this operation
        if (permissionChecker.isAllowedTo(operationDelete, resource)) {
            em.remove(sample);
            return Response.noContent().build();
        }
        return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
    }
}

=== Frontend

The frontend is done in a seamless way and other components don't need to know about the existence of Hawkular
Accounts at all. When the application is loaded, the Hawkular Accounts frontend plugin interacts with hawt.io's OAuth
plugin, which in turn interacts with Keycloak's JavaScript adapter.

Hawt.io's OAuth plugin adds the authentication token (formally: "bearer token") to the requests going to the backend
via an AngularJS interceptor, so, your frontend plugin doesn't need to do anything.

Hawkular Accounts handles the context switcher for personas, and you might want to register listeners for a couple of
events that are emitted from it: `CurrentPersonaLoaded` and `SwitchedPersona`. As their names suggest, those events
are emitted as soon as Hawkular Accounts detects which persona is the current one (`CurrentPersonaLoaded`) and as
soon as the user has changed the current persona using the "Persona Switcher" (`SwitchedPersona`).

image::/img/dev-docs/persona-switcher.png[Persona Switcher at the UI]

While in development mode, you might want to adapt your `index.html` to include the required UI elements and
JavaScript components. On the `ui/console` build from the main `hawkular` maven module, this is already done.

In particular, you'll need to:

* Add the hawkular-accounts JavaScript and CSS to your index.html
* Add some UI elements, such the account switcher and the countdown notification.

Please, refer to the `index.html` from the `accounts` plugin at `hawkular-ui-components` for an example of what's
required.

== CLI access

Requests coming from the CLI need to pass the authentication data for an user via CLI,
which can be done via basic auth for a _context_ (metrics, alerts, ..) and _endpoint_ :

[source,bash]
----
curl -v http://user:pass@localhost:8080/context/endpoint
----

To retrieve a list of tenants you would run:
[source,bash]
----
curl -v http://user:pass@localhost:8080/hawkular/inventory/tenant
----

If this user is impersonating an organization, the organization's ID should be passed via the `Hawkular-Persona`
HTTP header:

[source,bash]
----
curl -v -H 'X-Hawkular-Persona: uuid' http://user:pass@localhost:8080/context/endpoint
----

A list of possible personas for a given user can be obtained via:
[source,bash]
----
curl -v http://user:pass@localhost:8080/hawkular-accounts/personas
----
