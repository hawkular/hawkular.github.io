I would like to present you functionality of Hawkular Data Mining module.

Hawkular Data Mining module can be deployed in Hawkular and can be used to predict future values of metrics.
Predicted values are automatically sent to Alerts where conditions are evaluated and an alert can be triggered.

=== Time series models
At the beginning, we link:http://www.hawkular.org/blog/2015/10/24/hawkular-datamining.html[started] with linear
regression in Apache Spark. This simple model was a good start. Now we use Holt's linear trend method which is
a variant of exponential smoothing with linear trend. For an alert forecasting it is important to model a trend.
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average[ARIMA] models
were also proposed, however they require stationary time series and periodical recalculation of parameters would
have to be done. Which requires all historical data in place. For seasonal time series we plan to use Holt Winters
model which is just an extension of the model which is currently used.

=== Data Mining with Hawkular
Predictions are by default disabled. Enabling can by done by creating Relationship from Tenant to Metric, MetricType
or Tenant. Relationship to Tenant enables forecasting of all metrics under given Tenant, to MetricType enables all
metrics of given type. Configuration properties at lower levels override uppers.

Configuration has only one property -- forecasting horizon in seconds. If a new metric data is available
module predicts future values up to the last timestamp + forecasting horizon. Then, the predicted
values are sent to Alerts where conditions are evaluated.

.Hawkular with integrated Data Mining:
--
 $ git clone -b datamining git@github.com:hawkular/hawkular.git
 $ cd hawkular
 $ mvn clean install -Pdev
 $ dist/target/hawkular-*/bin/standalone.sh
--

.Enable prediction for Heap Used Metric, link:https://gist.github.com/pavolloffay/5c0a7aea318818f59293[helper functions].
--
 $ tenant=$(curl -s GET 'http://jdoe:password@localhost:8080/hawkular/inventory/tenant'| grep --color=never -oP 'path" : "\K/t;[0-9a-z\-]+')
 $ metric=`feed`'/m;MI~R~%5B'`feedId`'%2FLocal~~%5D~MT~WildFly%20Memory%20Metrics~Heap%20Used'
 $ curl -ivX POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" 'http://jdoe:password@localhost:8080/hawkular/inventory/tenants/relationships' -d '{
     "name": "__inPrediction",
     "source": "'$tenant'",
     "target": "'$metric'",
     "properties": {"forecastingHorizon": 150}
 }'
--

Now, we can query predictions for any time in the future. Of course we cannot get reasonable result for predictions
of further future. Confidence intervals widen as the forecast horizon increases. The rate at which the
confidence interval widen is a function of the selected model. The prediction API takes the number of steps to the
future for which it returns the predicted values. One step is equal to the interval at which given metric is collected.
So the number of steps intuitively corresponds to n future measurements.

.Get five step ahead predictions for Heap Used metric, link:https://gist.github.com/pavolloffay/5c0a7aea318818f59293[helper functions]
--
 $ metricId='MI~R~%5B'`feedId`'%2FLocal~~%5D~MT~WildFly%20Memory%20Metrics~Heap%20Used'
 $ curl -s GET -H 'Hawkular-Tenant:'`tenantId` 'http://localhost:8080/hawkular/datamining/models/'$metricId'/predict?ahead=5'

=== As Standalone
Hawkular Data Mining can be used also as standalone application. Following snippets of code show how to create a new
model directly through Data Mining REST API, insert data and get predictions.

.Create model
--
 $ curl -ivX POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Hawkular-Tenant: tenant1' 'http://localhost:8080/hawkular/datamining/models' -d '{
    "metricId": "metric1",
    "collectionInterval": "150"
   }'

 $ curl -ivX POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Hawkular-Tenant: tenant1' 'http://localhost:8080/hawkular/datamining/models/metric1/learn' -d '[
   {"timestamp": 1, "value": 1},  {"timestamp": 2, "value": 10}, {"timestamp": 3, "value": 20},
   {"timestamp": 4, "value": 40}, {"timestamp": 5, "value": 50}]
  ]'

 $ curl -ivX GET -H 'Hawkular-Tenant: tenant1' 'http://localhost:8080/hawkular/datamining/models/metric1/predict?ahead=5'

== What's next?
 * Improve model - estimate smoothing parameters from historical data
 * Holt-Winters seasonal version, model AR process with adaptive filter
 * Select the most important metrics and tune models for them
