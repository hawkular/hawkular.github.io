CloudNativeCon happened last week in Berlin and Hawkular APM was represented there
with a talk, link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utCOfSz202o["Operational and Business Insights from Tracing Distributed Microservices"].
Here's a short summary of the event, with a focus on OpenTracing.

This event was co-located with KubeCon and as you would expect, pretty much
everything revolved around Kubernetes. There were quite a few tracing vendors
with booths and/or in the audience: Instana, DataDog, Dynatrace, Sysdig,
CA Technologies, among others. It was a great opportunity to talk to them,
watch each others demos, exchange ideas and invite them to the OpenTracing
community. A few of them have components which are similar in purpose to some that
we are developing as part of "opentracing-contrib" and would be the perfect opportunity
for a collaboration!

After the talk, we were able to answer some questions around OpenTracing and
Hawkular APM. Those with good questions got

There was also quite some interest in OpenShift: most people knew about it already and
among those who didn't, most seemed impressed by its user interface once presented to it.

On the last day, there was a Distributed Tracing Salon: in this workshop, people
were able to get started with OpenTracing by using a demo application written in
Go and adding instrumentation to it. The final goal was to see the traces on
Zipkin's user interface, and I believe most participants reached the goal! Those
who didn't could continue working on it after the workshop, as the
link:https://github.com/tedsuo/ot-walkthrough-go[source code] is available on GitHub.

It was also a great opportunity to meet some OpenTracing members from LightStep,
and I made sure to smuggle a few stickers and T-Shirts back to Munich, to be distributed
during meetup talks there. All the videos from this conference, including the
ones from the OpenTracing track, can be watched on

Some interesting topics were brought up during the conference, a few of them more than once:

* What's the overhead? Hint: As OpenTracing is a specification and API, the
overhead is dependent on the concrete implementation.
* Multiplexer: sending traces to more than one backend seems to be a common use-case.
* Should the "wire transport" be part of the specification?
* Should an export format, like `pcap`, be part of the specification?
* What can be used for "reacting" on data (alerting)? Hint:

is a great alternative and can be used as a standalone solution!

And you, what's your opinion on the questions related to the specification?
