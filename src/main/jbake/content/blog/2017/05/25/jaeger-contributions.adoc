I am happy to announce that we made easier deploying Jaeger on Kubernetes clusters. With more
ongoing contributions to Jaeger project we set up new https://github.com/jaegertracing[Jegertracing]
organization on Github. At the moment this organization holds repositories for Kubernetes and OpenShift
templates.

Currently, we provide templates for deploying all-in-one distribution. This bits are designed for demo
and test purposes since it uses only in memory database. Be careful and do not use it in production!
More sophisticated templates with pure microservice approach and Cassandra storage will be available soon.

Templates have been tested against minikube and minishift using excellent integration tests framework
https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube[Arquillian Cube].
