Hawkular Alerting is a pluggable, API-driven component for adding alerting to your application or tool.  It's one of the many http://hawkular.org[Hawkular] offerings for monitoring and management.  To help quick-start new users, and as a reference for current users, we've released the first five lessons of a new tutorial, with more to follow.  It's a great way to hit the ground running.
