In a production deployment of Jaeger, it may be advantageous to restrict access to Jaeger's Query
service, which includes the UI. For instance, you might have internal security requirements to allow
only certain groups to access trace data, or you might have deployed Jaeger into a public cloud.
In a true microservices way, one possible approach is to add a sidecar to the Jaeger Query service,
acting as a security proxy. Incoming requests hit our sidecar instead of reaching Jaeger's Query service
directly and the sidecar would be responsible for enforcing the authentication and authorization constraints.

Incoming HTTP requests arrive at the route ①, which uses the internal service ② to resolve and communicate
with the security proxy ③. Once the request is validated and all security constraints are satisfied, the
request reaches Jaeger ④.

NOTE: A newer version of this blog post is available on link:https://medium.com/jaegertracing/protecting-jaeger-ui-with-an-oauth-sidecar-proxy-34205cca4bb1[Jaeger's blog]

For demonstration purposes we'll make use of link:http://keycloak.org[Keycloak] as our security solution, but
the idea can be adapted to work with any security proxy. This demo should also work without changes with
link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[Red Hat SSO]. For this exercise, we'll need:

* A Keycloak (or Red Hat SSO) server instance running. We'll call its location `${REDHAT_SSO_URL}`
* An OpenShift cluster, where we'll run Jaeger backend components. It might be as easy as `oc cluster up`
* A local clone of the link:https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-openshift/blob/master/production/jaeger-production-template.yml[Jaeger OpenShift Production template]

Note that we are not trying to secure the communication between the components, like from the Agent to the Collector.
For this scenario, there are other techniques that can be used, such as mutual authentication via certificates, employing
link:https://istio.io/[istio] or other similar tools.

=== Preparing Keycloak

For this demo, we'll run Keycloak via Docker directly on the host machine. This is to stress that Keycloak
does *not* need to be running on the same OpenShift cluster as our Jaeger backend. 

The following command should start an appropriate Keycloak server locally. If you already have your
own Keycloak or Red Hat SSO server, skip this step.

```bash
docker run --rm --name keycloak-server -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=password -p 8080:8080 jboss/keycloak
```

Once the Keycloak server is up and running, let's create a realm for Jaeger:

1. Login into Keycloak (http://<YOUR_IP>:8080/auth/admin/master/console) with `admin` as username and `password` as password
1. In the top left corner, mouse over the `Select realm` box and click `Add realm`. Name it `jaeger` and click `Create`
1. On `Clients`, click `Create` and set `proxy-jaeger` as the name and save it
1. Set the `Access Type` to `confidential` and `*` as `Valid Redirect URIs` and save it. You might want to fine tune this in a
production environment, otherwise you might be open to an attack known as
link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet["Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards"].
1. Open the `Installation` tab and select `Keycloak OIDC JSON` and copy the JSON that is shown. It should look like this,
but the `auth-server-url` and `secret` will have different values.

```json
{
  "realm": "jaeger",
  "auth-server-url": "http://192.168.2.111:8080/auth",
  "ssl-required": "external",
  "resource": "proxy-jaeger",
  "credentials": {
    "secret": "7f201319-1dfd-43cc-9838-057dac439046"
  }
}
```

And finally, let's create a role and a user, so that we can log into Jaeger's Query service:

1. Under the `Configure` left-side menu, open the `Roles` page and click `Add role`
1. As role name, set `user` and click `Save`
1. Under the `Manage` left-side menu, open the `Users` page and click `Add user`
1. Fill out the form as you wish and set `Email verified` to `ON` and click on `Save`
1. Open the `Credentials` tab for this user and set a password (temporary or not).
1. Open the `Role mappings` tab for this user, select the role `user` from the `Available Roles` list and click `Add selected`

=== Preparing OpenShift

For this demo, we assume you have an OpenShift cluster running already. If you don't, then you might want to check out tools
like link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift[`minishift`]. If you are running a recent version of Fedora, CentOS or
Red Hat Enterprise Linux you might want to install the package `origin-clients` and run `oc cluster up --version=latest`.
This should get you a basic OpenShift cluster running locally.

To make it easier for our demonstration, we'll add `cluster-admin` rights to our `developer` user and we'll create 
the Jaeger namespace:

```bash
oc login -u system:admin
oc new-project jaeger
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin developer -n jaeger
oc login -u developer
```

=== Preparing the Jaeger OpenShift template

We'll use the link:https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-openshift/blob/master/production/jaeger-production-template.yml[Jaeger OpenShift Production template]
as the starting point: either clone the entire repository, or just get a local version of the template.

The first step is to add the sidecar container to the `query-deployment` object. Under the `containers` list, after we
specify the `jaeger-query`, let's add the sidecar:

```yml
        - image: jboss/keycloak-proxy
          name: ${JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME}-query-security-proxy
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /opt/jboss/conf
            name: security-proxy-configuration-volume
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8080
            protocol: TCP
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: "/"
              port: 8080
```

Note that container specifies a `volumeMount` named `security-proxy-configuration-volume`: we'll use it to store the
proxy's configuration file. You should add the volume under the `spec/template/spec` node for `query-deployment`, sibling to
the `dnsPolicy` property (it's probably right under the previous code snippet):

```yml
        volumes:
          - configMap:
              name: ${JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME}-configuration
              items:
                - key: proxy
                  path: proxy.json
            name: security-proxy-configuration-volume
```

Now, we need to specify the `ConfigMap`, with the proxy's configuration entry. To do that, we add a new top-level item to
the template. As a suggestion, we recommend keeping it close to where it's consumed. For instance, right before the `query-deployment`:

```yml
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: ${JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME}-configuration
    labels:
      app: jaeger
      jaeger-infra: security-proxy-configuration
  data:
    proxy: |
      {
          "target-url": "http://localhost:16686",
          "bind-address": "0.0.0.0",
          "http-port": "8080",
          "applications": [
              {
                  "base-path": "/",
                  "adapter-config": {
                    "realm": "jaeger",
                    "auth-server-url": "${REDHAT_SSO_URL}",
                    "ssl-required": "external",
                    "resource": "proxy-jaeger",
                    "credentials": {
                      "secret": "THE-SECRET-FROM-INSTALLATION-FILE"
                    }
                  }
            ,
            "constraints": [
                      {
                          "pattern": "/*",
                          "roles-allowed": [
                              "user"
                          ]
                      }
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }
```

Note that we are only allowing users with the role `user` to log into our Jaeger UI. In a real world scenario, you might
want to adjust this to fit your setup. For instance, your user data might come from LDAP, and you only want to allow users 
from specific LDAP groups to access the Jaeger UI.

The `secret` within the `credentials` should match the secret we got from Keycloak at the beginning of this exercise. Our
most curious readers will note that we mentioned the template parameter `REDHAT_SSO_URL` under the property `auth-server-url`.
Either change that to your Keycloak server, or let's specify a template parameter, allowing us to set this at deployment time.
Under the `parameters` section of the template, add the following property:

```yml
- description: The URL to the Red Hat SSO / Keycloak server
  displayName: Red Hat SSO URL
  name: REDHAT_SSO_URL
  required: true
  value: http://THE-URL-FROM-THE-INSTALLATION-FILE:8080/auth
```

WARNING: This value should be a location that is reacheable by both your browser and by the sidecar, like your host's LAN IP (192.x, 10.x).
Localhost/127.x is not going to work.

As a final step, we need to change the service to direct requests to the port `8080` (proxy) instead of `16686`. This is done
by changing the property `targetPort` on the service named `query-service`, setting it to `8080`:

```yml
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: ${JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME}-query
    labels:
      app: jaeger
      jaeger-infra: query-service
  spec:
    ports:
    - name: jaeger-query
      port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8080
    selector:
      jaeger-infra: query-pod
    type: LoadBalancer
```
As a reference, here's the link:https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-openshift/blob/KeycloakSecuringUI/production/jaeger-production-template.yml[complete template file]
that can be used for this blog post.

=== Deploying

Now that we have everything ready, let's deploy Jaeger into our OpenShift cluster. Run the following command from the same
directory you stored the `YAML` file from the previous steps, referenced here by the name `jaeger-production-template.yml`:

```bash
oc process -f jaeger-production-template.yml | oc create -n jaeger -f -
```

During the first couple of minutes, it's OK if the pods `jaeger-query` and `jaeger-collector` fail, as Cassandra will still
be booting. Eventually, the service should be up and running, as shown in the following image.

endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
image::../../../../../assets/img/blog/2017/2017-07-18-pod.png[Pod with sidecar on OpenShift]
endif::[]

Once it is ready to serve requests, click on URL for the route (https://jaeger-query-jaeger.127.0.0.1.nip.io). You should be
presented with a login screen, served by the Keycloak server. Login with the credentials you set on the previous steps, and you
should reach the regular Jaeger UI.

=== Conclusion

In this exercise, we've seen how to add a security proxy to our Jaeger Query pod as a sidecar. All incoming requests go through
this sidecar and all features available in Keycloak can be used transparently, such as 2-Factor authentication, service accounts,
single sign-on, brute force attack protection, LDAP support and much more.
