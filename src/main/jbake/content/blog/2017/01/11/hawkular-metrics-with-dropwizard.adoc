_Dropwizard metrics_ (aka. Codahale aka. Yammer) is a well known, successful metrics framework that is easy to plug in a Java application.
You just create a metrics registry, create metrics, feed them et voil√†.
But Dropwizard metrics doesn't store anything by itself, it's delegated to the so-called "reporters".
So we've built the _hawkular-dropwizard-reporter_.

This article will show you:

- how you can create custom metrics
- how you can take advantage of existing middleware that uses Dropwizard metrics
- how to fine-tune the Hawkular reporter to make data exploitation easy

As an example, I will use a very simple application to benchmark some data structures (caches) in real time, and output results as metrics.
This is not a serious benchmark and we don't really care about the results: our purpose is nothing more than to illustrate how we can work with Hawkular and Dropwizard.

There's an infinity of possible use cases for metrics reporting, the most obvious being your production monitoring.

=== Minimal setup

You need very few things to start using the Hawkular Dropwizard reporter. Obviously, you must have a running instance of _Hawkular Metrics_. Then, add a _maven_ dependency to your Java application:

``` xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hawkular.metrics</groupId>
        <artifactId>hawkular-dropwizard-reporter</artifactId>
        <version>0.1.1</version>
    </dependency>
```

In your Java code, create a _MetricRegistry_ and pass it to the _HawkularReporter_:

``` java
    MetricRegistry registry = new MetricRegistry();
    HawkularReporter hawkularReporter = HawkularReporter.builder(registry, "com.hawkular.sample")
            .build();
    hawkularReporter.start(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

And that's it. From now on, all metrics that is added to the registry will be reported to Hawkular Metrics.
The default configuration expects to find the Hawkular server on _localhost:8080_. You can explore the builder options to configure it.

TIP: In this example, "com.hawkular.sample" refers to the tenant used in Hawkular. You can set whatever you want instead. link:http://www.hawkular.org/hawkular-metrics/docs/user-guide/#_tenants[Learn more] about Hawkular's multi-tenancy.

If, for instance, we want to connect to an Hawkular pod running in OpenShift, we would configure the reporter similar to that one:
``` java
    HawkularReporter hawkularReporter = HawkularReporter.builder(registry, "com.hawkular.sample")
            .uri("https://metrics.192.168.42.63.xip.io/hawkular/metrics")
            .bearerToken("ABCDEFGHIJ1234")
            .build();
```

To conclude with the initial setup, note that it is often a good practice to include some host-based disambiguation string in the metric names,
so that if your application is deployed on several hosts and they all communicate to the same Hawkular instance using the same tenant,
they will not conflict and feed the same metrics.
A convenient way to do that is to set a prefix in the reporter configuration, for instance using the host name:

``` java
    String hostname;
    try {
        hostname = InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName();
    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
        hostname = "?";
    }
    HawkularReporter hawkularReporter = HawkularReporter.builder(registry, "com.hawkular.sample")
            .prefixedWith(hostname + ".")
            .build();
```

=== Dropwizard -> Hawkular

As stated before, our sample app will do some (very) basic benchmarking on several caches implementations: we'll have a _Guava_ cache and a local _EhCache_.

NOTE: This sample app is on my GitHub: https://github.com/jotak/hawkular-dropwizard-sample

We create a very simple interface that allows us to get data from cache, count number of elements and know if the latest read was from cache or not:

``` java
interface Backend {
    Object get(String key);
    long count();
    void init(Map<String, Object> presetElements);
    boolean isLastReadFromCache();
}
```

You can link:https://github.com/jotak/hawkular-dropwizard-sample/tree/master/src/main/java/com/hawkular/sample[see on GitHub] the `GuavaBackend` and `EhcacheBackend` implementations, there's nothing fancy here.

EhCache is initialized programmatically:

``` java
    CacheManager cacheManager = CacheManager.newInstance();
    Ehcache cache = cacheManager.addCacheIfAbsent("testCache");
```

Now, the `Benchmark` class. This is where I create metrics and feed them, with the pretext of a small scenario. Here's the constructor:

``` java
    Benchmark(MetricRegistry registry, Ehcache ehcache) {
        // (1)
        this.registry = registry;
        // (2)
        final DatabaseStub fakeDb = new DatabaseStub();
        // (3)
        final BackendMonitoring guavaMonitoring = new BackendMonitoring(new GuavaBackend(fakeDb), GuavaBackend.NAME);
        final BackendMonitoring ehcacheMonitoring = new BackendMonitoring(new EhcacheBackend(fakeDb, ehcache), EhcacheBackend.NAME);
        // (4)
        Map<String, Object> presetElements = IntStream.range(0, 10000)
                .mapToObj(Integer::new)
                .collect(Collectors.toMap(i -> UUID.randomUUID().toString(), i -> i));

        guavaMonitoring.runScenario(presetElements);
        ehcacheMonitoring.runScenario(presetElements);
    }
```

(1) It gets the _Dropwizard_ `MetricRegistry`, as this is where all metrics are, obviously, registered.

(2) The class `DatabaseStub` is used to simulates a database with latency, using just a `HashMap` for storage: link:[see here]

(3) It creates one `BackendMonitoring` per `Backend` implementation -- this class will be described later.

(4) It creates a collection of items to store in cache, and use them in the scenario.

Here is `BackendMonitoring`

``` java
    private class BackendMonitoring {
        private final Backend backend;
        private final String name;
        private final Timer readTimer;

        private BackendMonitoring(Backend backend, String name) {
            this.backend = backend;
            this.name = name;
            registry.register(name + ".size", (Gauge<Long>) backend::count);
            readTimer = registry.timer(name + ".read");
        }

        private void runScenario(Map<String, Object> presetElements) {
            System.out.println("Starting scenario for " + name);
            final Meter readCacheMeter = registry.meter(name + ".cache.read");
            final Meter readDbMeter = registry.meter(name + ".db.read");
            final Counter numberItemsRead = registry.counter(name + ".total.read.count");
            // Setup preset elements
            backend.init(presetElements);
            List<String> keys = new ArrayList<>(presetElements.keySet());
            ThreadLocalRandom rnd = ThreadLocalRandom.current();
            Stopwatch watch = Stopwatch.createStarted();
            while (watch.elapsed(TimeUnit.SECONDS) < 60) {
                int pos = rnd.nextInt(0, keys.size());
                runWithBenchmark(() -> {
                    backend.get(keys.get(pos));
                    if (backend.isLastReadFromCache()) {
                        readCacheMeter.mark();
                    } else {
                        readDbMeter.mark();
                    }
                    numberItemsRead.inc();
                });
            }
            // Reset metrics
            backend.init(new HashMap<>());
            registry.remove(name + ".cache.read");
            registry.remove(name + ".db.read");
            registry.remove(name + ".total.read.count");
            System.out.println("Ending scenario for " + name);
        }

        private void runWithBenchmark(Runnable r) {
            final Timer.Context ctx = readTimer.time();
            try {
                r.run();
            } finally {
                ctx.stop();
            }
        }
    }
```

Here we create several metrics. Remember that since we associated the Hawkular reporter to the metrics registry, all metrics will automatically get reported into Hawkular.

- `registry.register(name + ".size", (Gauge<Long>) backend::count);` => creates a _Gauge_ that will track the number of elements in cache.
- `readTimer = registry.timer(name + ".read");` => creates a _Timer_ metric. Each time the `runWithBenchmark` method is called, that timer gets the `Runnable` execution time.
- `Meter readCacheMeter = registry.meter(name + ".cache.read");` => a _Meter_ that is invoked each time data is taken from cache (rather than DB).
- `Meter readDbMeter = registry.meter(name + ".db.read");` => the opposite: a _Meter_ that is invoked each time data is taken from db.
- `Counter numberItemsRead = registry.counter(name + ".total.read.count");` => a _Counter_ that tracks the total number of reads. We could actually get rid of it, because its value could be retrieved from readDbMeter.count + readCacheMeter.count (yes, a _Meter_ includes a _Counter_).

You can learn more about _Dropwizard_ metric types link:http://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/getting-started/[from its documentation].

Now, let's run the benchmark. I'm using link:http://grafana.org/[Grafana] with its link:https://grafana.net/plugins/hawkular-datasource[Hawkular plugin] to display graphs.

=== Middleware -> Dropwizard -> Hawkular

So, we know how to create metrics. That's perfect to track values that are very specific to an application. But the best is that a lot of existing Java middleware already provides tons of metrics on Dropwizard, that you can integrate very easily in your application.

There is a non exhaustive list in Dropwizard documentation (link:http://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/manual/[here] and link:http://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/manual/third-party/[there]), it includes Ehcache, Apache Http client, etc.
But they are actually many others. Some frameworks, link:http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-hawkular-metrics/java/[like Vert.X] may also report metrics directly to Hawkular, so you don't even need to go through Dropwizard at all.

Since we're already using EhCache in our sample app, let's try to get EhCache specific metrics. We need first to add a maven dependency:

``` xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.dropwizard.metrics</groupId>
      <artifactId>metrics-ehcache</artifactId>
      <version>3.1.2</version>
    </dependency>
```

When we initialized EhCache programmatically, we will create an `InstrumentedEhcache` object, which is its Dropwizard avatar:

``` java
    CacheManager cacheManager = CacheManager.newInstance();
    Ehcache cache = cacheManager.addCacheIfAbsent("testCache");
    Ehcache instrumentedCache = InstrumentedEhcache.instrument(metrics.registry(), cache);
```

And then we use `instrumentedCache` instead of `cache` in the rest of our code. That's it. Every time something is done on EhCache, metrics will be feeded.

See for instance what we get in Grafana, when the `EhcacheBackend` is invoked during our scenario:

ifndef::env-github[]
image::/img/blog/2017/2017-01-11-dropwizard-ehcache.png[EhCache metrics]
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
image::../../../../../assets/img/blog/2017/2017-01-11-dropwizard-ehcache.png[EhCache metrics]
endif::[]
_Here we track some metrics such as the gets and puts mean, the number of memory hits and misses. See the link:http://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/manual/ehcache/[full list of available metrics]._

What else could we do... We're on the JVM, right? We could get monitoring data from MX Beans (such as `MemoryMXBean`) and create our own metrics in Dropwizard, but there's already a module for that:

``` xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.dropwizard.metrics</groupId>
      <artifactId>metrics-jvm</artifactId>
      <version>3.1.2</version>
    </dependency>
```

After creating the `MetricRegistry`, you can add some preset JVM metric sets, such as `GarbageCollectorMetricSet`, `MemoryUsageGaugeSet`, `ThreadStatesGaugeSet` etc.

Having them in Hawkular will help you to quickly correlate information, such as an increasing memory heap or non-heap usage related to the use of a cache in our example.

ifndef::env-github[]
image::/img/blog/2017/2017-01-11-dropwizard-jvm.png[JVM metrics]
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
image::../../../../../assets/img/blog/2017/2017-01-11-dropwizard-jvm.png[JVM metrics]
endif::[]
_Heap vs non-heap memory used, plus some counters on threads and GC._

NOTE: An interesting fact is that the _Cassandra_ database also exposes metrics through Dropwizard. And _Hawkular_ uses _Cassandra_ internally for metrics storage. Which means that it can be self-monitored with the Hawkular Dropwizard reporter. If you want to read more on this subject, check out link:https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Metrics[Cassandra metrics] and link:https://github.com/jotak/hawkular-dropwizard-reporter#usage-as-an-addthis-plugin-in-cassandra[some instructions here].

=== Fine-tuning the reporter

==== Tagging

There are some improvements we can bring to our sample app. First of all, we could tag our metrics.

Tagging may not seem very important at first sight, but over time when you get more and more metrics, and when you try to exploit them in a dynamic way, tags become crucial.

Even for this sample app, when building the Grafana dashboard we soon want to make it generic so that it can show any other competing implementation of caches. In order to do it, we will create per-metric tags based on regexp. Just by adding a few lines in `HawkularReporter` builder:

``` java
    HawkularReporter hawkularReporter = HawkularReporter.builder(registry, "com.hawkular.sample")
            .addRegexTag(Pattern.compile(GuavaBackend.NAME + "\\..*"), "impl", GuavaBackend.NAME)
            .addRegexTag(Pattern.compile(EhcacheBackend.NAME + "\\..*"), "impl", EhcacheBackend.NAME)
            .addGlobalTag("hostname", hostname)
            .prefixedWith(hostname + ".")
            .build();
```
And as you can see I also added a global tag with the hostname.

With that configuration, every metrics whose name starts with _"guava."_ will be tagged _"impl:guava"_, and similarly for ehcache.
And every metric reported through this reporter will be tagged with the hostname.

==== Filtering

If you use Grafana with this sample app, you've probably noticed how annoying it is to find and select the metric you want to display,
because it's flooded among tons of other metrics. And obviously, the more you store metrics, the more resources will be consumed. So you can filter out metrics you don't want.

There's two kind of filters:

- the usual built-in Dropwizard filters, that you can set using `HawkularReporterBuilder.filter` and by implementing link:http://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/apidocs/com/codahale/metrics/MetricFilter.html[MetricFilter]
- another kind of filter that is very specific to the Hawkular reporter, called _MetricComposition_ and for which I must provide some details:

As stated before, _Dropwizard_ has several metric types (gauges, meters, timers etc.), some of them being composed of multiple values. So they don't match 1-1 with _Hawkular_ metric types, which are made of simple values (basically, _doubles_ for _gauges_ and _longs_ for _counters_ -- there are other types but unused in the dropwizard reporter).

In order not to loose any piece of data, _Dropwizard_ metrics are _exploded_ into several metrics in _Hawkular_. For instance, a Meter named _guava.cache.read_ will be translated to 4 gauges (_guava.cache.read.1minrt_, _guava.cache.read.5minrt_, _guava.cache.read.15minrt_, _guava.cache.read.meanrt_) and 1 counter (_guava.cache.read.count_) in _Hawkular_. The full translation table is link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-dropwizard-reporter#how-it-works[described here].

From the Dropwizard point of view, there is no metric called "guava.cache.read.1minrt". So you cannot filter it out with Dropwizard filters. However you can act on the "metric composition" in the Hawkular reporter. Either by providing the full metric name:

``` java
    // builder.
      .setMetricComposition("guava.cache.read", Lists.newArrayList("1minrt", "meanrt", "count"))
```

or using regexp, as I'm doing in the sample app:

``` java
    HawkularReporter hawkularReporter = HawkularReporter.builder(registry, "com.hawkular.sample")
            .addRegexTag(Pattern.compile(GuavaBackend.NAME + "\\..*"), "impl", GuavaBackend.NAME)
            .addRegexTag(Pattern.compile(EhcacheBackend.NAME + "\\..*"), "impl", EhcacheBackend.NAME)
            .addGlobalTag("hostname", hostname)
            .prefixedWith(hostname + ".")
            .setRegexMetricComposition(Pattern.compile("net\\.sf\\.ehcache"), Lists.newArrayList("mean", "meanrt", "5minrt", "98perc", "count"))
            .setRegexMetricComposition(Pattern.compile(".*"), Lists.newArrayList("mean", "meanrt", "count"))
            .build();
```

Here, we configure all _net.sf.ehcache.*_ metrics (EhCache middleware metrics) to provide their _mean_, _meanrt_, _5minrt_, _98perc_ and _count_ attributes. All other attributes will be discarded.
For all other metrics we only keep _mean_, _meanrt_ and _count_.

The declaration order matters, since only the first matching pattern will be used for a given metric name.

TIP: Using plain string rather than regexp for metric composition is more efficient, since they are internally indexed in a `HashMap`.

That was a quite complete tour of the Hawkular Dropwizard reporter. Again, the sample app used to illustrate this article can be found on my GitHub: https://github.com/jotak/hawkular-dropwizard-sample and the GitHub page of the reporter itself, along with its documentation, is here: https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-dropwizard-reporter.
