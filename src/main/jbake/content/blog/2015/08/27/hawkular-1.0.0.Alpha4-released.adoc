Hawkular, the monitoring platform, is happy to announce the release of its fourth milestone 1.0.0.Alpha4.

== Improvements in Alerts definitions

Alerts are there to inform the user about an occurrence of a problem in some of the monitored resources. The present
release adds some new configuration dialogs and improves the existing ones.

There are new configuration options to setup Alerts based on JVM Heap Usage and Garbage Collection.

There is a new dialog to configure Alerts for Datasources.

== Red Hat Access Portal Integration

We added an integration with the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Access Portal] to Hawkular.
Users with valid Access Portal credentials are now able to browse the Knowledge Base, view and create Support Cases
using the Hawkular user interface. On the future releases, we plan to improve this integration by adding more features.
If that sounds interesting to you, we are looking forward for your feedback on #hawkular channel on
link:https://freenode.net/[Freenode].

== Backend

While these changes in backend are not used by the UI yet, they present an important step towards a new UI functionality
in future releases:

* Hawkular Inventory now provides an API for configuration of resources and Hawkular Agent is using this API.
* Hawkular Bus and Agent now support the execution of operations on any resource
  link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HAWKULAR-483[HAWKULAR-483].
* Hawkular Bus offers a new infrastructure to stream large data from UI to monitored Application Servers.
  This is especially important for another feature that was added in the backend, namely the support for deploying
  applications on monitored Application Servers.
