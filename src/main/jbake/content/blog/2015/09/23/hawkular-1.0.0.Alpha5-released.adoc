Hawkular, the monitoring platform, is happy to announce the release of its fourth milestone 1.0.0.Alpha5.

== Improvements in WildFly handling

It is now possible to upload deployments to managed WildFly servers

On the deployments subtab, there is now a button that triggers a wizard to upload a deployment to a managed server

endif::[]

There is also a new dialog to add a JDBC driver to a managed WildFly server

[[img-add-jdbc-driver]]
.Add JDBC-Driver button

endif::[]

And last but not least it is possible to obtain a so called 'JBoss Diagnostic Report' from a managed server, which
can then be sent to Red Hat support when a case has been opened. You will find a button at the end of the WildFly
server pages.
