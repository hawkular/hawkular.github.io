Hawkular, the monitoring platform, is happy to announce the release of its sixth milestone 1.0.0.Alpha6.


=== Alert Center

We have started providing the so called 'Alert Center', a place where you can see all fired alerts and alert
definitions in one place

endif::[]



=== Organizations

We have also started providing support for organizations, where a user may belong to
zero, one or more organizations. This to support multi-tenancy in Hawkular, so that
it could be run in a central installation, but with multiple separate departments only
seing their own resources

=== Creation and deletion of Data sources

There is also a new dialog to add a Datasource to a managed WildFly server

[[img-add-jdbc-driver]]
.Add Datsource button and action drop-down

endif::[]

=== Agent installer

We have now a little helper, the wildfly-agent installer, that makes it much easier to install
the agent inside a WildFly server.

.Run the installer
--
   java -jar target/hawkular-wildfly-monitor-installer-0.10.1.Final-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar \
     --module=/path/to/module.zip \
     --wildfly-home=/opt/wildfly-9.0.0.Final \
     --hawkular-server-url=http://myServer:8080
--

Hawkular Agent is then installed to Wildfly Server `/opt/wildfly-9.0.0.Final` as a module and is able to
report to Hawkular Server located at `http://myServer:8080`.

Note that the installer uses a default of jdoe/password for _user/password_ that is encoded in
a properties file inside the installer jar. If you need a different value you need to edit those properties.

We will in the future (also) support the WildFly Feature packs.
