I would like to introduce a module which will provide functionality for predicting alerts and also showing forecasts
of metrics in Hawkular UI.

== Architecture
Let's start with the architecture how it fits to Hawkular. This module isn't intended to work in standalone fashion.
Used algorithm inside the engine will eventually change but architecture will remain as is described in the following
diagram.
On application startup, or if forecast for given metrics gets enabled, predictive model is initialized with data from
metrics module. If there is a new metric data available on the bus, it recalculates the model and provide users with
better
predictions. For alert prediction it is crucial to know the threshold value. Predicted value is compared to the
threshold
and if necessary, an alert event is posted on the bus. Predicted values for arbitrary timestamps can
be queried through REST API.

This module is not yet included in the main Hawkular distribution; therefore has to be started from separate application
server. To run this application, execute maven with dev profile. It produces configured wildfly in target directory of
hawkular-datamaning-dist module. Later it will be possible to deploy it as standalone web application in the Hawkular
server.

.Assuming the Hawkular server is running:
--
   mvn clean install -Pdev && ./hawkular-datamaning-dist/target/wildfly-*/bin/standalone.sh
--

== Algorithm
Metric data are basically streams of data coming from feeds therefore the algorithm has to recalculate weights of
predictive model for each new incoming data in order to get the most accurate results (online learning).
Apache Spark was chosen to provide streaming and distributed data processing engine. At the moment only local mode of
Apache Spark is used.

In the following chart regression line of 'Heap Used' metrics is showed. Currently, the line is drawn on
top of the historical data, the plan is to have it on the right to denote the future predictions.

.Yellow line is showing the result of linear regression of 'Heap Used' metrics.

So far I have been using linear regression with stochastic gradient descent. However this model doesn't fulfill
the requirements to get accurate results and predict seasonality. It was a good start to establish the architecture.
Further I'm going to
continue with more sophisticated methods like ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average) and investigate
possibility of using neural networks.

== Goals
* Provide an alert prediction for given set of metrics. Users should be able to optionally enable a prediction.
* Show forecast of near future in Hawkular UI.

== Next steps
* Customize charts for forecasting https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HAWKULAR-738[HAWKULAR-738]
* Seasonal ARIMA model
* Forecasting with Multi-Layer neural networks
