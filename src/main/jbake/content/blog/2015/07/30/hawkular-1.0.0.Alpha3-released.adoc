We are very happy to release the third version of Hawkular!
As with the previous one, this was the most important release of Hawkular so far.

== App server support

The main focus of this release clearly was the extended monitoring of http://www.wildfly.org/[WildFly] application
servers.


NOTE: For the moment you will need to instrument your server manually following
http://www.hawkular.org/docs/user/getting-started.html#_install_a_wildfly_monitoring_agent[these instructions].
We will make this easier in the future.

Deployments in the monitored server can now be enabled/disabled and redeployed. Deployment of new content
will come in the next release.

We also have a new _web_-tab that gives statistics about the web subsystem of the managed WildFly

== More details for URLs

Hawkular now also collects the current IP address and the server information for the URLs being monitored
