== Basic installation of Hawkular Server

There are two main components to install Hawkular server, the server itself and Cassandra.
Fortunately both are easy to install.

=== Apache Cassandra
You need a running Cassandra cluster to get started, they are various ways to install it,
any would do and you only need to know the IP/Hostname and port of your Cassandra server.

Developers of Hawkular Services all have their own preference depending on the operating
system they use and experience, here is one option, using ccm:

. First link:http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/ccm-a-development-tool-for-creating-local-cassandra-clustershttp://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/ccm-a-development-tool-for-creating-local-cassandra-clusters[install ccm]
. Create a cluster (of one for now) of Cassandra 3.7 for Hawkular, (with start_rpc enabled) and start it:

.ccm commands
----
ccm create hawkular -v 3.7 -n 1
ccm updateconf "start_rpc: true"
ccm start
----

Now Cassandra should be running on your machine on the default port.

=== Hawkular Services
. Grab the https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-services/releases/latest[latest distribution of Hawkular Services],
the file name should look like: hawkular-services-dist-x.y.z.Final.zip (or .tar.gz)
. Unzip the package in the directory of your choice, we'll call it `$HS_HOME`
. Create as many users as you need (replace `myUsername` and `myPassword` by the values of your choice):

 sh $HS_HOME/bin/add-user.sh -a -u myUsername -p myPassword -g read-write,read-only

. Hawkular Services is ready to start assuming Cassandra is running on the same machine, on the same port.

NOTE: If Cassandra in running on a different machine, on non standard port or if you have a cluster of Cassandra nodes,
you may need to do `export CASSANDRA_NODES="cassandra_host1,cassandra_host2,..."` prior to start Hawkular Services.
The `CASSANDRA_NODES` environment variable should be a comma-delimited list
of Cassandra node endpoint addresses. The value for each address should match the
value of the `rpc_address` in the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file. You do not
actually have to specify the address of every Cassandra node. As long as Hawkular
is able to connect to one node, it will discover all of the other cluster nodes.

.. To just start Hawkular Services:

`sh $HS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh`

..  To start Hawkular Services with the embedded WildFly agent (this is used to monitor itself since
Hawkular Services is based on WildFly and the embedded agent can push metrics and inventory to Hawkular
Services). Replace `myUsername` and `myPassword`, with a userame/password combination as defined in the step 3.

`sh $HS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -Dhawkular.rest.user=myUsername -Dhawkular.rest.password=myPassword -Dhawkular.agent.enabled=true`

. Hawkular Services should be starting, and soon you should be able to access: http://localhost:8080
to get confirmation that all the services are running

== Using SSL / HTTPS
