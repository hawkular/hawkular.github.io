== Install Hawkular

Please refer to the link:../installation-guide/[installation guide] to install Hawkular Server

== Step 1: Add metrics
In this quickstart guide, we'll start by injecting metrics in the server. For this part we don't need additional metadata nor tags on our metrics,
we really want to start as quickly as possible, advanced features will be explained in other documents.

Let's say we want to insert Weather temperature from a sensor so that we can keep an history and then visualize or alert on those values.

NOTE: Hawkular Services provides different libraries for different languages, but here we will just use the REST API with CURL.

Copy the following content in a file named `request.json`, it contains weather data collected every 30 min for the whole day of July 15th 2016.

.request.json
----
include::includes/request.json[]
----

To insert metrics, we just need a running Hawkular Server and make sure we created a user according to the instructions. You can replace the values of the `Hawkular-Tenant` and `temperature` in the URL
with the values of your choice, in this simple scenario, we don't need to make additional calls to create those.

----
curl -u myUsername:myPassword -X POST http://localhost:8080/hawkular/metrics/gauges/temperature/raw -d @request.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Hawkular-Tenant: myTenant"
----

Now your data is stored in Hawkular Server, in it's distributed Cassandra server. It's ready to be used !

== Step 2: Read the metrics
=== With Grafana
At the end of Step 1, you need to trust Hawkular that the data was indeed stored.
The most elegant way to see the data is by link:/hawkular-clients/grafana/[setting up Grafana and its Hawkular plugin] to actually build a dashboard and look at the `temperature` metric over that day (July 15th 2016) for `myTenant`.
Here would be the result:

endif::[]

=== With the REST API

The metrics API provides ways to retrieve raw or aggregated values, here is a command to get back the raw value as we inserted earlier.
The URL is the same, the command is a GET instead of a POST and we added extra parameters to define from when to when we want the values,
and that we want the data ordered by time.

.Curl command
----
curl -u myUsername:myPassword \
  -X GET "http://localhost:8080/hawkular/metrics/gauges/temperature/raw?start=1468533600000&end=1468618200001&order=ASC" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Hawkular-Tenant: myTenant"
----

This would be the result of that command:

.Command result
