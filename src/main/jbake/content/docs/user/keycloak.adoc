== Introduction

http://keycloak.org[Keycloak] is an SSO solution for web apps, mobile and RESTful web services. Hawkular bundles its
own Keycloak server instance, pre-configured with a realm, UI theme and event listeners. From the very beginning,
this integration has been thought of as a key part of authentication for Hawkular, without leaving out the fact that
Keycloak would possibly already exist in some environments, so, Hawkular allows Keycloak to be on an external Wildfly
instance. This document outlines all aspects of Hawkular's integration with Keycloak.

== Hawkular Accounts

The integration between Keycloak and Hawkular is done via the component Hawkular Accounts. This component is
responsible for managing the personas, organizations and other Hawkular particularities. Hawkular Accounts should
always live with the main Hawkular instance, while Keycloak might be
link:external-keycloak.html[deployed on an external server].

== Master password

Although Hawkular itself doesn't have a "super admin" or "root" user, Keycloak ships with one. To be consistent with
the official Keycloak distribution, the admin account is unchanged. In other words: once you have your Hawkular
server available in a public server, the admin's password should be changed.

To do so, simply access http://<your-hawkular-instance>:8080/auth/admin , login as "admin" with the password "admin".
After that, Keycloak will request a password change for this user.

== Hawkular realm

Hawkular ships with a Keycloak realm under `$WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/configuration/hawkular-realm.json`. On developer
builds, the realm template `$WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/configuration/hawkular-realm-for-dev.json` is used instead. To
control which realm is imported, the system property `keycloak.import` can be tweaked, either via `-D` when booting
Wildfly or by changing it on the `$WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`. Note, however, that this
import happens only during the first boot, as Keycloak won't import a realm that exists already. If changes are
required for the realm on an existing Hawkular instance, it should be done via the Keycloak admin interface.

The two template realm files should be identical in features, except for:

* The production build has a strict password policy, which matches the password policy for Wildfly.
* The developer build has a pre-registered user, with the login "jdoe" and password "password".

== Event Listeners

Keycloak allows the installation event listeners, so that applications can be notified when something of interest
happens regarding user or admin activities. Hawkular uses this feature to get notified when some events are
triggered and ships with two event listeners for Keycloak. As the role of those publishers is mainly to re-publish the
events to Hawkular, only one of the listeners should be *active* at any given point in time, even though both are
deployed and available by default.

To switch listeners, login to Keycloak's admin interface, select the realm 'Hawkular' and add/remove the listener via
the "Events" / "Configuration" screen:

For automated deployments, this can be changed before the first boot on the realm template file
`$WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/configuration/hawkular-realm.json`, under the `eventsListeners` entry:

`hawkular-realm.json`:
[source,json]
----
{
  "id" : "hawkular-realm",
  "realm" : "hawkular",
  "enabled" : true,
  ...
  "eventsListeners" : [ "hawkular-jms", "jboss-logging" ],
  ...
}
----

=== Event publisher - JMS

This event listener receives the events from Keycloak and publishes them to Hawkular via JMS. This is the default
event listener and should be used when Keycloak and Hawkular are running on the same Wildfly instance. The name on
the configuration for this listener is "hawkular-jms".

=== Event publisher - REST

This event listener receives the events from Keycloak and publishes them to Hawkular via the REST endpoint
`http://<hawkular-server-instance>:8080/hawkular-accounts-events-backend/events`. The actual URL for the endpoint should
be configured on the `standalone.xml` from the Keycloak server via the system property
`hawkular.events.listener.rest.endpoint`. The name on the configuration for this listener is "hawkular-rest".

WARNING: This endpoint is *not* protected. Make sure to properly secure it via Wildfly or, if available, an HTTP
server that runs in front of it. Ideally, only the Keycloak server should have access to this endpoint.
