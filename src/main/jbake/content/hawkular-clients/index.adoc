= Protocol translation
Some solutions are able to emit/push metrics to external parties, for some of them Hawkular can listen to those solutions and push metrics into Hawkular, it means that if a metric is exposed
in one of the supported solution, it would be added to Hawkular by installing the corresponding protocol translator (At this time, one "agent" supports the whole list).
