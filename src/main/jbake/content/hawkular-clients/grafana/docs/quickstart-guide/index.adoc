This project is the Hawkular Datasource plugin for Grafana 3. It works with:

* Metrics standalone servers as well
* Hawkular servers, starting from version Alpha13

== Installing

NOTE: If you don't have Grafana yet, link:http://grafana.org/download/[download and install it].

=== From source

Download the source code and copy the content of `dist` to `hawkular` inside Grafana's plugin directory:

[source,bash]
----
# This is the default for Linux Grafana installs. Change it to match yours, if needed.
GRAFANA_PLUGINS=/var/lib/grafana/plugins
wget https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource/archive/release.zip -O hawkular-grafana-datasource-release.zip
unzip hawkular-grafana-datasource-release.zip
mkdir ${GRAFANA_PLUGINS}/hawkular
cp -R hawkular-grafana-datasource-release/dist/* ${GRAFANA_PLUGINS}/hawkular
----

=== From the Grafana plugin directory

The Hawkular datasource is available on the link:https://grafana.net/plugins/hawkular-datasource[Grafana plugin directory]. You can install it using link:http://docs.grafana.org/v3.0/plugins/installation/[grafana-cli]:

[source,bash]
----
grafana-cli plugins install hawkular-datasource
----

== Configuration

The datasource URL must point to the Hawkular Metrics service, e.g. `http://myhost:8080/hawkular/metrics`

`direct` access mode only works with standalone Metrics servers currently. If you active it, make sure to allow
the Grafana server origin in Metrics' configuration.

Authentication must be set when working with a Hawkular server. Check the 'Basic Auth' box and fill the user and password fields.

Select the tenant. On Hawkular servers, use `hawkular`.

Openshift-Metrics users must provide an authentication token.

== Usage

=== Queries

When adding a Graph panel, the Metrics tab allows you fetch _Gauges_, _Counters_ and _Availability_ metrics in Hawkular. You can either search by metric id or by tag, assuming your version of hawkular-metrics is at least 0.20.0. Prior versions only allow searching by id.

TIP: To know your version of hawkular-metrics, check the "status" endpoint. E.g. `http://myhost:8080/hawkular/metrics/status`

When searching by id, you must provide the exact metric id (or use variables, as discussed later).

When searching by tag, you must provide the tag key, followed by its value or any pattern recognized by Hawkular Metrics. Check how link:http://www.hawkular.org/hawkular-metrics/docs/user-guide/#_tag_filtering[tagging works in Hawkular].

- To add more tag filters, hit the "+" button and repeat the process.
- To remove a tag, click on its key and select "Remove tag".

image::docs/images/search-by-tag.png[caption="Example of query by tag"]

TIP: Note that querying by tag may return multiple series for a single query, as illustrated above.

When using a _Singlestat_ panel, some additional options come in. The Hawkular Datasource plugin can perform aggregations on multiple metrics, which usually the _Singlestat_ panel doesn't. It's actually a two-steps aggregation: first, multiple series are reduced into a single one (that is either the sum of its parts, or the average). Then, the resulting series is aggregated over time through another folding: min, max, average etc.

image::docs/images/single-stats-aggreg.png[caption="Example of singlestat panel"]

TIP: Note that because the aggregation takes place in Hawkular, the _Singlestat_ panel has nothing to aggregate. Thus in panel options, setting whatever in the _value_ field on the _Big value_ won't have any effect. However if you don't want to use the Hawkular aggregation, just set _Multiple series aggregation_ to _None_.

=== Templating variables

Grafana allows you to create dashboard templates through the definition of variables. This is link:http://docs.grafana.org/reference/templating/[documented on Grafana's site].
With the Hawkular Datasource Plugin, the variables of type _'Query'_ are mapped to the http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html#GET__metrics[_@get (url)/metrics_]
Hawkular Metrics endpoint and can be used to retrieve tenant's metric names. Use the _Query Options_ text field to pass query parameters, as illustrated below:

image::docs/images/query-for-metrics.png[caption="Example of query by tags to get metric ids", width="600"]

[TIP]
For instance, if you have metrics tagged _"type:memory"_ and others tagged _"type:cpu"_, you can write _"tags=type:memory"_ to get only the _"memory"_ ones, or _"tags=type:cpu|memory"_ to get them both.

There is an exception to that rule: if the query string is prefixed with _'tags/'_, the variable will contain the matching tag names rather than the metric names. In this case, the Hawkular Metrics endpoint link:++http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html#GET__metrics_tags__tags_++[_@get (url)/metrics/tags/{tags}_] will be used.

image::docs/images/query-for-tags.png[caption="Example of query to get matching tag values", width="600"]

[TIP]
For instance, type _"tags/type:*"_ to get all of the available tag values for _"type"_.

Once you have set some variables, you can use them in graph queries: either for row or graph duplication, or to display multiple series in a single graph from a single query. This is especially useful when metric names contain some dynamic parts and thus cannot be known in advance.

== Building

You need `npm` and `grunt` to build the project.
Clone link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource[the repository from github], then from that directory run:

[source,bash]
----
npm install
grunt
----

Files are generated under the `dist` directory.
To test your build, copy these files to `${GRAFANA_PLUGINS}/hawkular` and restart grafana-server.

== Running with Docker

Docker images are available on docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource/

To run it:

[source,bash]
----
# This will run the image on http://localhost:3000/
docker run -i -p 3000:3000 --name hawkular-grafana-datasource --rm hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource:latest
----

To build the docker image with the latest git release:

[source,bash]
----
# This will build the image
cd docker
docker build -t hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource .
----

## Troubleshooting

### Grafana fails to establish a connection or get data from hawkular

* Check the URL: `[host]/hawkular/metrics`. Make sure there's no ending slash. When you open up this URL in a browser you should see the Hawkular logo, the installed version and a mention that the service is started.

* Make sure the credentials or token match your installation. In general, if you installed a **standalone hawkular-metrics** server without any specific configuration you probably don't have any authentication information to provide. If you installed **hawkular-services** using its link:http://www.hawkular.org/hawkular-services/docs/installation-guide/[installation guide] you will probably have to fill-in the basic auth fields. If you are using **Hawkular from OpenShift**, you have to provide a Bearer token in the `Token` field. Tokens can be link:https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html[generated temporarily] (go to `[OpenShift host]/oauth/token/request`) or from a link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/rest_api/index.html#rest-api-serviceaccount-tokens[Service account] in OpenShift.

* Check the javascript debugging tool of your browser. If you see an error mentioning issues with CORS, switch to `proxy` mode in the datasource configuration.

### I can't query by tag, the option is not displayed

Querying by tag was introduced before the plugin was properly versioned, so if you have a version >= 1.0.2 you should have it. However it is only enabled when Grafana talks to hawkular-metrics >= 0.20.0. To check your version of hawkular-metrics just open its status page in a browser (`[host]/hawkular/metrics` or `[host]/hawkular/metrics/status`).

### Connection is OK but I can't get any metric

Make sure the tenant you've configured is exactly the same than the one used to insert data. Beware that it is case sensitive. If you have any doubt about the actual presence of data in Hawkular, you can confirm with a `curl` command, for instance:

```bash
curl -u myUsername:myPassword \
  -X GET "http://myserver/hawkular/metrics/gauges/mymetric/raw" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Hawkular-Tenant: myTenant"`
```

More about the REST API: http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html

Also note that in Hawkular, data has a retention period of 7 days by default (link:http://www.hawkular.org/hawkular-metrics/docs/user-guide/#_data_retention_and_removal[it can be configured]). So if no data has been produced since that time, you won't be able to see anything.

### I'm running Hawkular in OpenShift, connection is OK but I can't get any metric

Check your version of hawkular-metrics (`[host]/hawkular/metrics` or `[host]/hawkular/metrics/status`). Prior to 0.16.0, metric names containing slashes, like in OpenShift, were unfortunately not showing up in Grafana. You can consider link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.html#manual-upgrading-cluster-metrics[upgrading metrics].
