== Overview

=== Media Type

The API uses *JSON* to communicate with clients.

You _should_ add the following accept header to your requests:

----
Accept: application/json
----

When you send JSON data with a `POST` or `PUT` request, you _must_ add the following content type header:

----
Content-Type: application/json
----


=== API Endpoints

Since the version 0.17.0.Final, Hawkular inventory has a new REST API.

There is a more detailed, generated, information about the endpoints further down in this document. The following
sub-chapters give an overview of the endpoints available and examples of their usage.

NOTE: The old API has been kept so that clients can gradually move to the new API, but the old API has moved from
`/hawkular/inventory` to `/hawkular/inventory/deprecated`.
The clients using the old API will have to be modified to use the new endpoint but are otherwise unaffected. We've
decided to not keep the old API on its original place and actually remove in some future version (but before
1.0.0.Final) because Inventory is not yet deemed stable and we don't want to spoil the first stable version with an API
that is not fulfilling its purpose.

==== Working With Entities
The endpoint `/hawkular/inventory/entity` provides full read-write access to individual entities (and relationships).

Single entities are addressed by their canonical paths. To learn more about the canonical paths, consult
link:../components/inventory/index.html#basic-principles[the documentation].

===== Read
To access some entity, simply append its canonical path as is (with or without the tenant id) to the endpoint URL.

I.e. to access a resource with id `myApp` which is in `prod` environment, use the following GET HTTP request:

  GET /hawkular/inventory/entity/e;prod/r;myApp

or

  GET /hawkular/inventory/entity/t;my-tenant/e;prod/r;myApp

if you want to include the tenant in the URL (i.e. use the canonical path as is). N. B. you still need to include the
tenant in the `Hawkular-Tenant` header though.

===== Create
To create a new entity, simply use the URL of its parent (an empty path if the entity is placed directly under a tenant)
and add a path segment with the type of the entity you are adding. As the body of the request, use the appropriate
blueprint type.

E. g. to create a new resource "myResource" under a feed "myFeed", issue:

  POST /hawkular/inventory/entity/f;myFeed/resource

  {
    "id" : "myResource",
    "resourceTypePath": "myResourceTypeUnderMyFeed"
  }

The paths in the payload of the post request are resolved against the parent under which the entity is being created.
I.e. in the example above the value of the "resourceTypePath" key is a relative path and is resolved against
`/t;myTenant/f;myFeed` (if `myTenant` is the current tenant) and thus is resolved as
`/t;myTenant/f;myFeed/rt;myResourceTypeUnderMyFeed`). Of course, you can also use the full canonical paths if you wish.
E.g. the following request would result in the same resource being created:

  POST /hawkular/inventory/entity/f;myFeed/resource

  {
    "id" : "myResource",
    "resourceTypePath": "/t;myTenant/f;myFeed/rt;myResourceTypeUnderMyFeed"
  }

Please consult the detailed documentation for the list of properties supported/required for the individual types of
entities.

===== Update
To update an entity, send a `PUT` request to the `/entity/...` endpoint with the update object for given entity type.
E.g.

  PUT /hawkular/inventory/entity/f;My%20Feed/r;RootResource/r;child-resource

  {
    "properties": {
      "admin's personal notes": "Seems to have stabilized in the new version..."
    }
  }

This will update the resource with ID "child-resource" contained within a "RootResource" resource under a feed with
ID "My Feed" (under the current tenant specified by the header) to have the above specified properties.

===== Delete
To delete a resource, send a DELETE request to its `/entity/...` endpoint. Deleting an entity will also recursively
delete all the child entities contained within it (i.e. deleting a feed will delete all resources, metrics, resource
types and metric types defined by it). It will NOT delete the entities otherwise associated with it. I.e. if a resource
incorporates a metric and the resource is deleted, the metric still exists.

===== Retrieving Tree Hash
The identity hash of entities that support it is based on the Merkle tree hash of their child entities. To retrieve this
tree hash (for example to quickly check if your local entity tree is the same), you can use:

  /hawkular/inventory/entity/f;feedId/treeHash

==== Traversing Many Entities

Inventory data forms a graph. Using the `/hawkular/inventory/traversal` endpoint one can compose traversals of this
graph that can search for certain entities. The traversals that can be expressed using the URL do not have the full
strength of general purpose graph-traversal language like http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/[Gremlin] but many
things can be achieved with them.

NOTE: In the future, there is a plan to support full Gremlin-based access to inventory.

The URL traversal of the inventory is an extension of the format of canonical path. E.g.

  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/f;feedId/r;resourceId

is a valid URL traversal, because `/f;feedId/r;resourceId` is a valid (tenantless) canonical path.

To be able to formulate efficient traversals, it is good to understand the inventory organization. Please consult
the http://www.hawkular.org/docs/components/inventory/index.html#inventory-organization[documentation] for its details.

Now to a more formal definition of the URL traversal (for the technically inclined, the traversal is described using an
http://github.com/hakwular/hawkular-inventory/hawkular-inventory-rest-api/src/main/antlr4/org/hawkular/inventory/rest/HawkularInventoryGetUri.g4[Antlr4 grammar]).

===== Filtering Entities

Each path segment in the URL traversal expresses a filter on the "current" set of entities. The filtering is performed
within a single URL path segment using a notation similar to HTTP matrix parameters.

Given an example traversal `/hawkular/inventory/traversal/type=feed;name=My%20Feed/r;resourceId` we'll be talking about
a single path segment, e.g. `type=feed;name=My%20Feed` or `r;resourceId`.

Given the example `type=feed;name=My%20Feed` you can spot two things:

* multiple filters can be used, separated by a semi-colon,
* within a single path segment everything must be percent-encoded (i.e. above we're looking for feeds with name
`My Feed`). Again this is in accordance with canonical path format which requires percent-encoding for IDs,
too.

//just splitting the above list from the below one
Canonical path segment as filter::
`r;resourceId` or `mt;AwesomeMetricType` are valid filters. The (one or two) letters perceding the first semicolon
specify the type of the sought-after entities (for the full list, check
http://hawkular.org/docs/components/inventory/index.html#basic-principles[canonical path format description]).

Other Filters::
** `type` -- only allows entities of the specified type. The type can be specified either as the segment type as in
the canonical path segments (`type=d`) or by their full name (no spaces, first letter lower-case, camel-case afterwards,
e.g. `type=resource`, `type=resourceType`, etc.). Multiple occurences of the `type` filter are or-ed together, i.e.
the sought-after entities must have one of the types specified.
** `id` -- only allows entities with the specified id. Multiple occurences of the filter are or-ed together, i.e. the
entities must have only one of the provided ids.
** `name` -- only allows entities with the specified name. Again, multiple occurences are or-ed together.
** `cp` -- only allows entities with the given canonical path. Note that you have to percent-encode the value so that
it can appear as a filter, e.g. `.../cp=%2Ft%3BtenantId%2Ff%3BfeedId/...`
** `propertyName` -- only allows entities which have a property of specified name (regardless of its value).
** `propertyName` & `propertyValue` -- if the URL traversal segment contains both `propertyName` and `propertyValue`
then they are matched together to compose a filter for entities having a particular property with a particular value.
It is possible to specify such pair more than once with the same property name, which will construct a filter for the
entities having a property with given name having one of the provided values. To illustrate the behavior, let's consider
the following examples:
*** `.../propertyName=a;propertyName=b` -- filters for entities that have both properties `a` and `b` with any value,
*** `.../propertyName=a;propertyValue=aa;propertyName=b` -- filters for entities that have both properties `a` and `b`.
The property `a` must in addition have the value of `aa`, while property `b` is free to have any value.
*** `.../propertyName=a;propertyValue=aa;propertyName=a;propertyValue=aaa;propertyValue=b` -- property `a` needs to have
the value `aa` or `aaa` and there must be a property `b` with any value.
*** it is not possible to express "an entity with a property `a` or a property `b`)
*** unmatched `propertyValue` filters are illegal, e.g. `.../propertyName=a;propertyValue=aa;propertyValue=aaa`
** `relatedBy` & `relatedTo` -- these two filters again come in pairs. One can filter for entities that are related to
some other entity by some relationship. The name of the relationship is defined by the value of `relatedBy` filter and
the canonical path (possibly tenant-less) of the entity is the value of `relatedTo`. E.g.
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/type=e;relatedTo=%2Ff%3BfeedId;relatedBy=incorporates
+
will return an environment that incorporates a feed with id `feedId`.
** `relatedBy` & `relatedWith` -- these are similar to `relatedBy` and `relatedTo` but the difference is in the
understood direction of the relationship. While `relatedTo` assumes and outgoing relationship,  `relatedWith` assumes an
incoming relationship. E.g.
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/type=f;relatedWith=%2Fe%3Benv;relatedBy=incorporates
+
will return all feeds that are incorporated by the environment with id `env`. Note that this can be equally expressed
as:
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/e;id/rl;incorporates/type=f
+
see the documentation about progressing the traversal on details about that type of traversal. `relatedWith` is
nevertheless provided because sometimes such an equivalent traversal in the "progressing" form cannot be constructed.
** `definedBy` -- a short cut for `relatedBy=defines;relatedWith=<<PATH>>`

Filter without canonical path segment::
It is valid to specify a filter without the canonical path segment. E.g.
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/type=environment/name=Guess%20Who%20I%20Am
+
which will look for all entities of any type which have a name "Guess Who I Am" and which are contained in any
environment.

NOTE: From the above, you can see that `.../traversal/f;feedId/r;resource` is actually the same as
`.../traversal/type=f;id=feedId/type=r;id=resource` only more concise.

===== Progressing the Traversal
In the previous chapter you could spot examples where multiple URL path segments were used, each specifying a filter.
That is actually an implicit type of progression, but other progressions are also possible.

Implicit Progression::
If two filters specified as URL path segments, the implicit progression from the first set of entities (specified by
the first filter) to the second set of entities is supposed to go over `contains` relationship. I.e. if we have the
following graph:
+
   +-----+             +-----+
   |  A  |--contains-->|  B  |
   +-----+             +-----+
+
The following URL will find the entity `B`:
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/id=A/id=B
+

Explicit Relationship Progression::
It is possible to explicitly specify what relationship the progression should progress in the graph:
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/id=A/rl;defines/id=B
+
I.e. the first filter `id=A` establishes a set of "source" entities. From those, the `rl;defines` instructs
the progression to go over the `defines` relationship (implicitly in the outgoing direction). The targets of those
relationships are then filtered using the `id=B` filter.
+
The full definition of the explicit relationship progression can be expressed by the pseudo regular expression:
+
  rl;<NAME>(;<DIRECTION>)?(;<FILTER>)*
+
  <NAME>;;
  Is the name of the relationship, e.g. `contains`, `defines` or other predefined relationships or indeed any
  user-defined relationship name.
  <DIRECTION>;;
  is the direction in which to follow the relationship. The possible values are `in` or `out` (with `out` being the
  default). The `in` direction means to go to the source entities of the relationships that target the current entity
  (the naming comes from the Gremlin traversal language and the logic is that the relationship points "in" the current
  entity).
  <FILTER>;;
  The relationships to follow can be filtered down using a number of relationship-specific filters. Those are:
  +
  *** `propertyName` & `propertyValue` -- with the same semantics as explained in the previous chapter,
  *** `name` -- is the name of the relationship, again with same semantics as for entity filters,
  *** `id` -- the id of the relationship,
  *** `sourceType` -- the type of the entity from which the relationship originates. This allows for the same values
  as the `type` filter for the entities (described above),
  *** `targetType` -- the type of the entity to which the relationship points. Again, this can have the same values
  as the `type` filter on entities.

Progressing To Identical Entities::
Certain entities have their http://hawkular.orgd/ocs/components/inventory/index.html#identity-hashing[identity hash]
automatically computed. This makes it possible to find all other entities of the same type that appear identical to
the current entity.
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/rt;Wildfly/identical/rl;defines/type=resource
+
The above query will first find a global resource type with ID "Wildfly", will then find all its identical resource
types (i.e. if some feed defines the same resource type, it will be included) and then from all those resource types
will follow the `defines` relationship and will output all the target entities of that relationship that are of type
`resource`.
+
This type of progression doesn't accept any filters.

Progressing Recursively::
Sometimes it is useful to retrieve all child entities recursively. For example to find all metrics of all child
resources, you can:
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/f;feed/r;rootResource/recursive;type=resource/rl;incorporates/type=metric
+
This will traverse to the `rootResource` resource, will find recursively all its child resources and from them
follow the `incorporates` relationship. From the entities targetted by those relationships, it will pick the ones with
type `metric`.
+
The full format of the recursive progression using a pseudo regular expression:
+
  recursive(;over=<REL>)?(;<FILTER>)*
+
  <REL>;;
  is the name of the relationship to recursively progress over. Defaults to `contains`.
  <FILTER>;;
  is any entity filter as specified in the previous chapter. Note that these filters are applied to each of the entities
  recursed over, so if an entity recursed over doesn't satisfy them, it will not be descended into.

===== Retrieving Relationships
If you know an ID of a specific relationship, you can access it directly using its canonical path using the single
entity access endpoint:

  /hawkular/inventory/entity/rl;<ID>

where `<ID>` is the id of the relationship.

If you want to find entities without knowing their exact ID, you can have a two of options:

Relationships Of Entities::
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/f;feed/relationships;in
+
The `relationships` ending segment can be augmented in the same way as an explicit relationship progression specified
above. I.e. you can specify the direction of the relationships returned (defaults to `out`) and you can limit the number
of the relationships returned using the relationship-specific filters.

Relationships In Traversal::
Using the `rl;<NAME>` progression you can "stay" at the relationships like so:
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/f;feedId/rl;myRelation/relationships
+
This ending segment doesn't accept any filters but will return all the relationships called "myRelation" going out of
the feed with id "feedId". If you want to obtain the incoming relationships this way, you can do:
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/f;feedId/rl;myRelation;in/relationship


===== Retrieving Entities Of Relationship
If you want to retrieve the "other ends" of a relationship during traversal and you don't want to restrict them or
continue your traversal using them, you can use the following idiom:

  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/f;feedId/rl;myRelation/entities

This will return all the entities that relationships with name "myRelation" going out of the feed with id "feedId" are
pointing to.

==== Examples
Access specific relationship::
+
  /hawkular/inventory/entity/rl;<ID>

Access all children of a resource::
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/e;envId/r;rootResourceId/recursive;type=resource

Access direct contained child resources of a resource::
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/e;envId/r;rootResourceId/type=resource

Access direct child resources of a resource::
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/e;envId;/r;rootResourceId/rl;isParentOf/entities

Access metrics of a resource::
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/e;envId/r;resourceId/rl;incorporates/type=metric

Access all resources identical to given one:
+
  /hawkular/inventory/traversal/e;envId/r;resourceId/identical

==== Listening To Inventory Events
The `/hawkular/inventory/ws/events` endpoint enables you to listen to inventory events as they happen. The types of
events you are interested in is specified using query parameters:

* `tenantId` -- because websockets cannot work with http headers, you need to supply the tenant for which you want
to receive the events as a query parameter.
* `type` -- the type of entities you want to receive events about. This accepts the same values as the `type` filter
in URL traversals.
* `action` -- the type of action you are interested in - can be `created`, `updated`, `deleted`,
`identity_hash_changed`.

==== Paging
The `/hawkular/inventory/traversal` endpoint supports paging of the results. Paging is controlled using query
parameters:

* `page` -- the number of the page to retrieve
* `per_page` -- the number results per page
* `sort` -- the name of the property to sort by. No sorting is applied if not specified, which is not recommended
because sorting then is data storage specific and can differ between requests. The properties available are the keys
in the returned JSON objects, e.g. "id", "path", "unit", "myCustomProperty"...
* `order` -- `asc` or `desc` for ascending or descending ordering of the results.
